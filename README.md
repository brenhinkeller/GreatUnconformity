# GreatUnconformity

This repository contains assorted Matlab and Julia codes used to run the calculations and make the figures used in [Keller et al. (2018)](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/12/26/1804350116), along with all relevant datasets. To generate the bootstrap-resampled zircon Hf and O isotope database, run [mctestZircon.m](zirconHfO/mctestZircon.m).

To run many of the matlab codes, you may first need to install (make discoverable on your path) https://github.com/brenhinkeller/StatisticalGeochemistry
